    <p>Hey there, I'm Suraj Kumar, currently pursuing my BCA from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). I'm deeply passionate about technology, especially web development, and I'm actively learning and building my skills in this area. Alongside my studies, I'm gaining practical experience as a clerk under an advocate, where I'm responsible for various administrative tasks. In addition to my BCA, I have also completed a diploma in technology from a local institute near me. With my educational background from CBSE, diploma in technology, and my current professional experience, I'm determined to make a mark in the tech industry. I'm eager to collaborate with organizations, contribute to innovative projects, and continue my journey of learning and growth in the field of technology.</p>
